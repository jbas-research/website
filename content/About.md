Hello! 

I'm Jesus Bas, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Center for Brain and Cognition ](https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc)(UPF). My research aims to understand the scope of infants and children’s social cognition, in particular how they represent the main properties of social relationships and resource distribution.

In parallel, I coordinate and teach several Psychology courses at the [Department of Experimental and Health Sciences](https://www.upf.edu/cexs/) (UPF).

Previously, I graduated in Psychology and specialized on Neuroscience, obtaining my PhD title in 2018 at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain) after two stays abroad at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/) (Hungary) and [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) (United States). My thesis focused on the influence of social hierarchies on infant's learning and was supervised by Núria Sebastián-Gallés. 

Later, I was  working with Olivier Mascaro on a project financed by the Fyssen Foundation investigating the representation of leader-follower relations during infancy. The project was developed at the [Institute for Cognitive Sciences - Marc Jeannerod](http://www.isc.cnrs.fr/) (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique- UMR 5304), Lyon, (France) in 2019 and at the [Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition Center](https://baby.biomedicale.parisdescartes.fr/en) (entre National de la Recherche Scientifique- UMR 8002 - Université Paris Descartes), Paris, France in 2021.
